Welcome to my personal website!

A bit about me:

I am a research professional based in Sherbrooke, QC, CAN. I currently work for Marc Bélisle at Université de Sherbrooke and for Jade Savage at Bishop's University. My work can be summarized as trying to apply statistical methods to research questions pertaining to agricultural entomology.

My work for Jade Savage focuses on *Delia* flies (*D. antiqua*, *D. radicum*, *D. platura* & *D. florilega*) for the Delia Project.
